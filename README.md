# college_3d_explorer
This is an prototype of an idea to make more easy navigation access of college's  with a 3d view.  
College 3D Explorer

📌 Project Overview

The College 3D Explorer is a web application designed to help students and visitors navigate a college campus using a 3D interactive interface. Users can explore different buildings, facilities, and locations in an intuitive and user-friendly manner. And this solves the problem that  freshers faced during early period of his college days to finding defferent places in big campus colleges.

Open index.html in a Browser
Simply double-click index.html or run a local server:

✨ How It Works

The sidebar lists different locations on campus. Clicking on an item will highlight it.

The 3D View (powered by Three.js) displays an interactive model of the campus.

The search bar allows users to quickly find specific locations.

we will add more options rather than there this is only a preview type.

📌 Future Improvements

🏗️ Add more detailed 3D models for better realism.

🗺️ Implement a 3d mini-map of department and section by section of college for easy navigation.

🔗 Integrate real-time campus events and announcements.(optional)

proper authentication for accessing this through only campus wifi so that internal visual data not been stealed.
